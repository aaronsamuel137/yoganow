A simple Django app for scraping and displaying yoga class schedules across many different studios in Boulder

The app is ready to deploy to Heroku.

As of now, there is code for scaping two yoga studio schedules in Boulder.
However, until I get explicit permission from the studios, their schedules will
not be posted. The plan is to iteratively add more studios as I have time and
get permission.
